description: ICBINB@NeurIPS 2021 - A Workshop for "beautiful" ideas that *should* have worked
---

## Description

The panel will be moderated by [Robert C. Williamson](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/research/core-research/cluster-of-excellence-machine-learning/research/research/cluster-research-groups/professorships/foundations-of-machine-learning-systems/) and will take place between **8:45-9:45 EST**.

In this event, we will ask the panelists a serious of challenging and interesting questions that get to the heart of what we collectively try to do in our machine learning research endeavours. Examples of questions that will be raised are the following:

* *What does success look like in ML research?*
* *How should we think of the field of ML: is it science, technology, both or neither?*
* *What are the differences between ML research and research in other sciences? And what can we learn from those differences and similarities?*
* *What is the role of beauty in ML research?*

The discussion will be lively, stimulating and hopefully a lot of fun. There will be plenty of time for anybody in the audience to ask questions for the panelists.
