#description: ICBINB@NeurIPS 2021 - A Workshop for "beautiful" ideas that *should* have worked
#---
#
#To adapt the workshop format to its virtual setting and prioritize creative discussions, we will have breakout discussions in small groups on [Gather Town](
#https://neurips.gather.town/app/5163xhrHdSWrUZsG/ICBINB).

#### What are breakouts?
#
#A breakout is a 30min informal discussion that will take place at **16h15-16h45pm EST** on the official [Gather.Town](https://neurips.gather.town/app/5163xhrHdSWrUZsG/ICBINB). The goal of this session is to share experiences related to the selected topic, find common interests, identify challenges/opportunities for improvement,  and brainstorm about ways to improve the research process overall. Each breakout will be moderated by a senior researcher, and will focus on a different step in the modeling process:
#
#| Topic         | Moderator |
#| Crazy data        | [Stephanie Hyland](https://sthy.land/pages/bio.html) |
#| Tricky priors         | [Roger Grosse](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rgrosse/) |
#| Muddled models      | [Isabel Valera](https://ivaleram.github.io/) |
#| Bumpy inference  | [Weiwei Pan](https://iacs.seas.harvard.edu/people/weiwei-pan)  |
#| Off metrics | [Tamara Broderick](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tbroderick/) |
#| | |
#
#If you want to participate in one of these sessions, you just have to go to the corresponding "carpet" in the virtual Gather.Town world. Each carpet is a private space where you can listen to or talk to everyone else. There is one whiteboard available in each breakout.
#
#The topics are wide on purpose, so that participants have the freedom to lead the discussion to wherever they want. Here some ideas for discussion:
#
#* Share experiences related to the topic
#* What is the biggest challenge?
#* Why is it difficult to fix?
#* What should we be done differently?
#* How do we encourage the sharing of negative results?
#* How to save papers from the graveyard of forgotten papers
