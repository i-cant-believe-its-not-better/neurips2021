We welcome the submission of research papers and abstracts from the broader ML community describing original work that has not been submitted or currently under review, has not been previously published nor accepted for publication elsewhere, in any other journal or conference. In particular, this work may touch on one or more of the following aspects:
* Unexpected negative results or anomalies: ideas that do not provide expected results, yet authors are able to explain why, bringing an interesting closed-form piece of knowledge to the community.
* Papers that are “stuck” yet contain beautiful/elegant ideas. Authors should argue why the idea is of interest, rigorously describe the analysis, and include a self-critique.
* Criticism of and alternatives to default or standard practices (e.g., current evaluation metrics).
* Meta-research on the role of “beauty” or negative results in broader ML research (including statistics, data science, AI, and application areas).


If you think your paper falls within the remit of the workshop but does not clearly fit one of these tracks, please contact the organizers at <cant.believe.it.is.not.better@gmail.com>

#### Formatting instructions

We will follow the same formatting instructions as in the main NeurIPS conference. In short, all submissions must be in PDF format and at most 8 pages long (shorter is fine and even better, we encourage authors to be concise); the appendix can have unlimited length. Submissions will be **double-blind**, so you should submit an anonymous preprint.

You must format your submission using the provided [LaTeX style files](https://www.aeoncase.com/link/d4dcff4cae6c03a9a460dfa1).

The maximum file size for submissions is 50MB. Submissions that violate the NeurIPS style (e.g., by decreasing margins or font sizes) or page limits may be rejected without further review.

<!-- Submissions should be 4 pages long at most (not including references) and submitted via OpenReview platform by September 17th 2021 (see our website for the submission link). The Appendix can be unlimited, but note that reviewers might only read the main text. Accepted authors will be invited to participate in a poster session at the workshop. These submissions are non-archival, however reviewers will nominate exemplar papers for submission in PMLR. -->

#### How to submit

Submissions to the workshop will be handled through our [OpenReview site](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2021/Workshop/ICBINB).

**Main deadline: **September 17th 23:59 Anywhere on Earth. Accept/reject notification will be sent out by September 31st.**

<!--**Late-breaking deadline: June 21 23:59 Anywhere on Earth. Accept/reject notification will be sent out July 1st.**-->

<!-- Camera ready versions will be submitted as markdown files through our [GitHub repository page](https://openreview.net/group?id=NeurIPS.cc/2020/Workshop/ICBINB) for publication online. -->

#### Reviewing criteria

Reviewing and awards: Reviewers will not be asked to assess “beauty”, but rather to evaluate whether authors have identified a gap between intrinsic and extrinsic value, broadly speaking, and have clearly explained their ideas. Reviewers will reward novelty and elegance, thorough understanding, transparency, and reproducibility, rather than high empirical performance. Reviewers will also nominate papers for two awards: the “Entropic Award”, for most surprising gap or negative result, and the “Didactic Award”, for most well-explained and pedagogical paper. Reviewers will also nominate papers with exemplary scientific rigor and high-quality research process for publication in PMLR.

<!--
We plan to create an open-minded and diverse space for promising works regardless of the final outcome by providing reviewers with concise guidelines that reward thorough understanding, transparency, and reproducibility rather than high performance. **Reviewers will nominate papers with exemplary scientific rigor for publication in PMLR**. Papers should clearly convey the interest of the unexpected behavior and demonstrate a high-quality research process.-->

<!-- We will be selecting for submissions that provide interesting insights on unexpected results. Morevover, we expect all submissions to follow the guidelines of basic courtesy and respect, and to abide by our [code of conduct](https://i-cant-believe-its-not-better.github.io/neurips2020/coc). While there is no page limit, we encourage authors to be concise. -->
